# !!!! -- THIS IS A FORK WHICH MAY NOT WORK -- !!!!

I just like this project. Therefore, i made a fork of it to adjust things for my needs - just for fun and learning.

Branch structure:
 - main -> latest test which mostly will not work 
 - TronickDev-version -> working with adjustments  -> is the release download version of this repo
 - kekeimiku-version -> latest version of kekeimiku -> https://github.com/kekeimiku/LuckySpeeder

TronickDev-version changes:
 - added more multipliers to choose of
 - changed the default speed value to 10f instead of 1f (not active still paused)
 - changed what buttons are shown in the contracted view

## FAQ

### Why does changing the speed have no effect in some games?

1. If possible, try turning off VSync in your game.

2. The game’s anti-cheat system might be preventing this.

3. The game uses a special timer, which LuckySpeeder currently cannot handle.
